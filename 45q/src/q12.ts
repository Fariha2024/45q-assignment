// q12:  Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[]= [ `fariha`, `fatima`, `Ali`, `ibrahim`,`urusa`];

 console.log(`Hello ${names[0]}, I am inviting you for a one dish party at my home.`);
 console.log(`Hello ${names[1]}, I am inviting you for a one dish party at my home.`);
 console.log(`Hello ${names[2]}, I am inviting you for a one dish party at my home.`);
 console.log(`Hello ${names[3]}, I am inviting you for a one dish party at my home.`);
 console.log(`Hello ${names[4]}, I am inviting you for a one dish party at my home.`);
