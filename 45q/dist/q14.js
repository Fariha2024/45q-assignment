// q14:  Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
let guestList = [`Ali`, `Usman`, `Zara`, `zuhaib`, `Beenish`];
for (let i = 0; i < guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Mr./Ms. ${guestList[i]}! You are invited at dinner on my birthday.`);
}
export {};
